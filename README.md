[[homepage](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/mad-pod-racing)]  [[code](coders_strike_back)]<br>
This puzzle game starts with a step by step tutorial that will help you get familiar with CodinGameâ€™s multiplayer games.
It provides an easy introduction to bot programming through a starship race.

The aim of the game is of course to win the race against other players! To succeed in this challenge, you will be able
to use different mathematical concepts such as trajectory calculation, collisions, speed vector, or inertia.

The game is very simple to start. Rules are easy to understand and it only requires a few lines of code to move your
ship around.

However, it has near-infinite possibilities of evolution as you can improve your artificial intelligence step by step,
while sharpening your coding skills.

Three players are pitted against one another in the arcade olympics.

Each player controls a character in four mini-games simultaneously. Earn a maximum of medals in all four games to
acquire the highest score.

The game is played in turns. On each turn, all three players perform one of four possible actions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or
RIGHT.

When an action is performed by a player, their agent in each mini-game performs that same action, because the controls
have been wired to all 4 machines at once.
